## Description

  With the emerge of high quality opensource tools for FPGAs new opportunities are rising to build and discover better digital architectures. This stick is inteded as lowest cost tool for anyone who desire to explore & research the world of modern digital systems. It can be used to develop, test and benchmark fairly large digital designs, straight using a complete opensource toolchain end to end.

  It can close the gap between emerging trend of high level generated systems (automatic reinforced exploration of arhitectures) and the lack of end to end toolchain ending on a real FPGA feedback.

  Let Here Be Dragons ! (Yetis are also welcome).


## Specs:

* Small size **16x40mm** usb stick
* Generous **85k LUT** **FPGA** logic space
* Holds **1Gbyte DDR3** memory with **x16** access
* USB3 **5Gbps/s** data access over **x32** independent FIFO
* USB2 outband (same usb port) permanent **JTAG** and **UART** independent access
* Full opensource HDL flow usig [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ) suite

Can be used in any USB from tip of fingers, no cables, no wires.

## Project files
* See [CircuitMaker](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Cristian-Balint/e-VEREST) for complete sch & pcb (KiCAD coming soon)
* Check [schematic](https://github.com/cbalint13/e-verest/raw/master/docs/schematic/e-VEREST.pdf) available as quick readable format.
* Software tools for managing the stick and examples coming soon (WiP)
* There are plans for buying units via CrowdSupply campains (WiP).
