## Description

  With the emerge of high quality opensource tools for FPGAs new opportunities are rising to build and discover better digital arhitectures. This stick is inteded as lowest cost must have tool for anyone who desire to explore & research the world of modern digital systems. It can be used to develop, test and benchmark fairly large digital designs, straight using a complete opensource toolchain. 

  It can also close the gap between emerging trend of high level generated systems (reinforced exploration of arhitectures) and the lack of toolchain flow ending with a real FPGA.

  Let Here Be Dragons ! (also Yetis are welcome).


## Specs:

* Small size **16x40mm** usb stick
* Generous **85k LUT** **FPGA** logic space
* Holds **1Gbyte DDR3** memory with **x16** access
* USB3 **5Gbps/s** data access over **x32** independent FIFO
* USB2 outband (same usb port) permanent **JTAG** and **UART** independent access
* Full opensource HDL flow

Can be used in any USB from tip of fingers, no cables, no wires.

## Project files
* See [CircuitMaker](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Cristian-Balint/e-VEREST) for complete sch & pcb (KiCAD coming soon)
* Check [schematic](https://github.com/cbalint13/e-verest/raw/master/docs/schematic/e-VEREST.pdf) available as quick readable format.
* Software tools for managing the stick and examples coming soon (WiP)
* There are plans for buying units via CrowdSupply campains (WiP).
